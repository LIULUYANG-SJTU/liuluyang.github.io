# Welcome to Luyang Liu's Homepage

I am a researcher focusing on surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices,
nonlinear electromechanical modeling, and finite element simulations.

My work involves nonlinear harmonic generation,
pre-stressed piezoelectric structures,
and numerical analysis of acoustic resonators.
